# Visualization using Tableau

**Objective**
- Learn about data attributes
- Build understanding on the correct plotting method based on data

I have tried exploring some interesting observations from Winter Olympics data from 1924 to 2006 using Tableau.  
Here is the [detailed report](https://github.com/arpitaj5/Data-Visualization/blob/master/Tableau/Tableau%20Visualization.pdf) for reference.

Here is the data in [csv](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~apjoshi/msds622/data/exercise1-olympics.csv) format and the [readme](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~apjoshi/msds622/data/exercise1-olympics-README.txt) file containing useful information about the data.
